We stayed at a hotel that had a pool and a game room.
I played pinball and video games sometimes.
I liked to swim in the hotel pool, but I liked the beach better.
I would lie on a big beach towel and get warm; then I would jump in the water and cool off.
Sometimes I would just lie on the sand and watch the waves roll up on the shore.
I found some seashells, and I saw a crab walking on the sand.
At first I was a bit lonely because I didn't know anyone there.
It wasn't long before I met some other kids my age.
We built sandcastles together and swam in the lake.
The other kids were from different towns, so we told each other stories about our schools and friends.
We found that we had a lot in common even though we were from different places.
Our families got together and went to restaurants together.
We played volleyball on the beach, and we sat around a campfire at night and sang songs.
At the campfire we would roast marshmallows on a stick.
I always burn my marshmallows.
That is okay.
I like them that way.
Mostly we just swam in the lake until we were very tired.
I was sorry when our vacation was over.
I had a good time at Lake Huron.
I met some very good friends there.
We still write to each other.
Maybe we'll see each other next summer.

My father is very happy because they are his parents, and he is glad that he will see them.
We don't see them very often because Calgary is a long way from Toronto.
My grandparents have two sons: my father and my Uncle Bill.
Uncle Bill is married to my Aunt Susan.
They have a daughter who is my cousin.
My cousin is a lot older than I, so we do not have a lot in common.
They also have a son who is the same age as me.
He is my favorite cousin because we both like the same television shows and the same games.
I have two brothers and one sister.
My brothers are both younger than I.

Article #72 Winter

Once the fall is over and the snowflakes start to fall I get very excited.
I can hardly wait for the ground to be covered with a blanket of white snow.
I put on my mittens, my scarf, my hat, coat and winter boots, and I run out into the fluffy snow.
I have to be careful not to slip on the ice.
It can get very icy and cold in the winter.
The first thing that I do is to build a snowman.
I sometimes build a snow fort too.
My friends and I like to have a good snowball fight.
We laugh a lot, and our cheeks and noses get very red.
When we get too cold, we go into the house and have a cup of hot chocolate.
My father fills the backyard with water that freezes and turns into an ice rink.
When the ice is hard enough, my friends and I get our skates and we go out on the ice to play hockey.
All of my friends own hockey sticks.
I am usually the goalie, and I have to keep the puck from going into the net.
My sister and her friends don't really like to play hockey.
They would rather just skate around on the ice.
I took skating lessons, so I don't usually fall down.
My little brother is just learning to skate, so he falls down a lot.
My father has to shovel the snow off the paths and the driveway in the winter.
I help him.
Shovelling snow is hard work.
When my Dad and I finish shovelling the driveway, we go into the house and warm our
hands and feet in front of the fireplace.
There is probably nothing more beautiful than fresh fallen snow on the trees.
In the morning, when the sun shines on the snow, it glistens.
I like to leave my footprints in the snow.
Winter can be very beautiful and exciting.

We play football and soccer at school.
After school, we ride our bikes through piles of dry leaves.
The leaves go flying through the air as we drive through them.
My parents rake the leaves up and put them in big pile.
I like to jump in the big piles of leaves, but then my parents just have to rake them up again.
The skies get a little cloudier in the autumn, and we know that soon there will be snow,
so we enjoy the brisk autumn weather while we can.

Yesterday I told a lie.
I don't feel very good about it.
I was bouncing a ball in the kitchen, and the ball bounced up and broke a cup.
It was one of my mother's best cups, so I was afraid that she would be mad.
I put the broken cup back on the table, and I didn't tell anyone that I had broken it.
That night, my mother asked who had broken the cup.
My brother said, "not me."
My sister said, "I didn't do it."
I said, "I didn't break the cup," but I was lying.
My mother said that we would all be punished, if someone didn't tell the truth and say
who broke the cup.
I still did not tell her that I had broken it.
She gave us one more chance, and said that she wasn't mad about the cup; she just wanted us to be honest.
I still didn't say anything.
My brother, sister and I all got sent to our rooms.
We had to stay in our rooms all morning.
My brother said that it wasn't fair.
I felt very bad because my brother and sister were being punished because of me.
I went to my mother and told her that I had broken the cup.
She said that she was not upset about the broken cup.
She knew that it was an accident.
She was disappointed in me because I hadn't come forward and told the truth.
She said that she wouldn't have punished me if I had been honest with her.
I told my brother and sister that I was sorry.
I felt bad because they were punished because I was dishonest.
I told my mother that I was sorry that I had lied to her.
I told her that I had learned a lesson.
Honesty is the best policy.
It is better to tell the truth.
It is not a good feeling when people don't trust you.
I have learned that lying just hurts people.
Sometimes it is hard to be honest, but it is the best way to be.

In December, Christmas comes.
We get a holiday from school, and our parents get a few days off from work.
Our family gets ready for Christmas by decorating the house.
We decorate inside and out.
On the outside of the house we put up lights that twinkle and glow.
We have a wooden Santa Claus and reindeer set that my father puts up on the roof.
Inside, we put up a Christmas tree.
Some years we have a real tree.
Real pine trees smell nice, but you have to be careful that they don't dry out and start a fire.
This year we have an artificial tree.
We hang tinsel and ornaments on the tree.
We also hang strands of lights on the tree and put a star at the top.
Everyone thinks that the tree is beautiful when we turn on the lights.
We place gifts under the tree.
There is a gift for me under the tree.
It is wrapped in red paper, and it has a big green bow on it.
Red and green are the Christmas colours.
On Christmas Eve, my brother and sister and I will hang our stockings near the fireplace.
Santa Claus comes down the chimney and fills our stockings full of toys and goodies.
On Christmas morning, it is exciting to see what Santa has left for you.
My mother will make a big turkey dinner for us on Christmas day.
We will have lots of vegetables and good tasting foods to go with the turkey.
We will have dessert too.
Some of my family like Christmas pudding, but I will just have ice cream.
Last year some carolers came to the door.
It was snowing outside.
They stood in the snow and sang Christmas carols to us.
My father gave them some money, and my mother gave them some hot chocolate to warm them up.
They had lovely voices, and they sang some of my favorite carols.
We also collect food, gifts and money for some of the people in town who cannot afford to have Christmas.
My family is collecting things for a poor family who live near here.
We had fun deciding which toys to buy for the children in that family.
It is a good feeling to share with people who do not have as much as you do.
My parents have always taught us that Christmas is a time for giving, not receiving.
I think they're right.

The garden is very interesting.
I sometimes go outside and I watch all the things that go on in the garden.
It smells wonderful in the flower garden.
There are red, white, pink and yellow roses that have a sweet smell.
I watch the bees as they take pollen from the roses.
There are tiny bugs that live on the rose bushes.
My mother tries to get rid of the little bugs, but it is difficult to get rid of them.
She is glad to see the red ladybugs, who eat the little bugs.
The birds like the sunflowers.
They like to eat sunflower seeds.
There is a birdbath in the garden.
The blackbirds and swallows go in there to take a drink or have a bath.
I sometimes see a robin or a bluejay in there too.
In the dirt there are little holes where the ants go in and out.
The ants are hard workers.
I watch them as they work together as a team to bring food to their nests.
There are snails in the garden too.
They carry their homes on their backs.
They move slowly and leave a silvery trail as they go. 
They eat the leaves from my mother's plants.
My mother also has vegetables growing in her garden.
She grows green peas.
We like to pick those and eat the peas raw, right out of their pods.
She grows lettuce and tomatoes too.
We have so many tomatoes that we always give some to our neighbours.
My mother sends us outside to pick lettuce and tomatoes whenever we have a salad.
My favorite vegetables are carrots.
Their tops grow above the earth, but the carrots are below the dirt.
When you pick them, you have to pull the carrots out from under the soil.
Weeds also grow in the garden.
After a good rainfall, it seems that the weeds just spring up.
I pull the weeds out by their roots so that they won't grow back.
Weeds choke the good plants, so we don't want them in our garden.
Gardening is a good hobby.
You get fresh air, sunshine and exercise.
You even get beautiful, colourful flowers and nice fresh food.

On Saturday, my parents took us to the pet store.
They had everything that you would need if you had a pet.
They had dog food, collars and leashes for dogs.
They had treats to give your dog, and brushes to brush your dog.
For cats, they had food, toys, and litter boxes.
For birds, they had seed and cages.
There was a section for fish.
They had fish in big tanks and little bowls.
In the big tanks, there were colourful fish swimming around.
The girl who worked there said that they were tropical fish.
There were goldfish in the smaller fishbowls.
I saw the girl get a goldfish out with a little net.
She sold it to a boy who said he had another goldfish at home.
There was a very large cage with a parrot in it.
I walked up to the cage, and the parrot said "hello."
I was surprised that the parrot could talk.
It could say a few things.
It said, "I love you," "pretty bird," and "bye-bye."
I told my mother that I would like a parrot, but she said that parrots need a lot of care and attention.
At the back of the store there were some puppies.
They seemed glad to see me.
I stuck my hand into the cage, and one of them licked my hand.
They were very lively.
They were running around and chasing their own tails.
In the next cage there were two kittens.
One of them was playing with a toy, and the other one was asleep.
The kittens were very small.
The one that was sleeping was curled up into a ball.
I couldn't even see her face.
I didn't want to leave the pet store.
I was wishing that I could take all of the animals home with me.

I was excited, but I was afraid.
I held my mother's hand as we walked to the school.
When we got near the school, I wouldn't let her hold my hand anymore.
I didn't want to look like a baby.
We got to the school.
The school looked very big and frightening.
There were children outside on the playground.
They all looked very big.
I looked at them, and some of them looked at me.
I felt very small.
My mother and I went into the school and found the kindergarten room.
There were children in there.
Most of them were the same size as me.
My mother spoke to the kindergarten teacher.
The teacher was very nice.
She said my name, and she introduced me to some of the other children.
I already knew some of the children because they lived near me.
I began to play with some of the things that were in the classroom.
There were toy trucks, colouring books, and even a doll house.
I soon forgot to be scared, and I began to play with the other children.
I didn't even notice that my mother had left the room.
In school we sang songs, played some games and listened as the teacher read us a story.
I had a lot of fun on my first day of school.
I even drew a picture of my teacher.
I took the picture home, and my mother put it on the refrigerator.
I like school.

People move from place to place.
There are lots of ways that you can move around from one place to another.
Sometimes you can just move your feet and walk.
Walking is good for you.
Some places are too far to walk to.
You might have to ride a bicycle or ride on a skateboard.
Some places are too far away to ride your bicycle to.
You might have to drive in a car, or a van, or even a truck.
My father has a car.
My uncle has a van.
I have never been in a big truck.
Trucks are usually used to carry big loads from one city to another.
I would like to be a truck driver.
I would travel all over and sit high up in the cab.
I have been in a taxi cab.
Once, my mother and I took a taxi to the hospital.
There was a special meter in the taxi.
When we finished our taxi ride, the driver looked at the meter to find out how much
money we owed him.
I once rode a horse.
I sat in the saddle and held on tight to the reins.
The horse ran very fast.
It was a bumpy ride, and I was afraid that I would fall off the horse.
Not too many people around here use horses for transportation.
They used to use horses for transportation in the old days.
If you want to travel very far away, you have to go on a train, a plane, or a boat.
If you are in a hurry, it is best to take a plane.
Planes fly through the air very fast.
Trains go along the tracks.
Sometimes I can hear the train whistle from my house.
Boats take a long time to cross the ocean.
Great big boats that cross the oceans are called ships.
If you like to take it easy and look out at the water, then ships are a good way to travel.
They say that the world is a lot smaller now because of transportation.
People can travel to all parts of the world quickly and easily.
The world is not really smaller, but it has become easy to get to faraway places.

Article #88 My Country

I live in Canada.
It is a very large country that is made up of ten provinces and three territories.
Most of the provinces and territories are quite unique.
For example, in Saskatchewan the land is flat, and it is not surrounded by water.
They grow wheat in Saskatchewan.
British Columbia has mountains.
I have never been to British Columbia, but I hear that it is very beautiful.
Nova Scotia is on the Atlantic Ocean, so there are many fishermen out there.
The people in the provinces are even different from each other.
In Quebec, many of the people speak French.
In the Maritime Provinces, the people like to play their own kind of music.
They play fiddles and accordions, and many of them dance very well.
Nunavut is in the north, so life is quite different there.
The people who live in the new territory of Nunavut are very close to wildlife.
They do a lot of hunting and fishing.
It can get very cold up in the Arctic where Nunavut is.
I live in Ontario.
Even within Ontario life can be quite different.
The capital of Ontario is Toronto.
Toronto is a very busy city with lots of apartments, offices and shops.
Toronto is an exciting place, and it has a lot to offer.
There are theatres and restaurants to suit every taste.
The culture in Toronto is very diverse.
If you drive a few miles north of Toronto, you will find places that are tranquil and peaceful.
Many people leave Toronto on the weekends and drive to their cottages where they find rest and relaxation.
Canada is made up of many different cultures.
People of many different ethnic backgrounds live in harmony in Canada.
That is why I like Canada.
In Canada we celebrate our differences.

I eat potato chips and candies.
These foods aren't part of a nutritious diet, but they are fun to eat.

I had a wonderful time there.
My favorite animals were the lions.
They look very powerful and strong.
They say that the lion is the king of the forest, and I think that title suits him.
The monkeys were funny.
They were looking at us just as much as we looked at them.
They were swinging from branches and doing tricks to impress us.
There was a baby monkey that was clinging to its mother's back. It was very cute.
The tigers were pacing back and forth.
They seemed restless.
The stripes on a tiger are very beautiful.
We watched the tall giraffes as they nibbled leaves off the tallest trees.
We spoke to a colourful parrot that spoke back to us.

There were clothes from the past.
I don't know how people wore some of those things.
They look like they would be uncomfortable.
I like to wear my jeans.
There were things from wars.
There were bullets, and cannons and even uniforms from the soldiers.
I don't think that war is a good thing, but it is good to remember the past and honour the
people who died for your country.
There was an old fire truck at the museum.
This fire truck was pulled by a horse.
There were some very old photographs of the firemen putting out fires.
There were rooms in the museum that were set up like an old house.
There were antique irons and sewing machines.
The women used to clean the clothes with a washboard.

There were arrowheads and cradles that the babies slept in.

Article #92 The Police

My mother always told me that if I was lost I could go up to a policeman and that he
would help me to find my way home.
I never did get lost, but I always remembered what my mother told me about the police.
I think policemen look very nice in their uniforms.
I see police officers drive by in their police cars.
In my town we even have police officers on bicycles.
Policemen and policewomen have a job that can sometimes be dangerous.
They have to catch people who break the law.
Sometimes, they have to chase people or try to calm people down.
To be a police officer you need a lot of training.
It is important to be able to deal with people effectively.
A police officer came to our school.
He had a police dog with him.
The officer showed us how the dog could track down criminals.
The dog was very smart.
He could even find things that were hidden.
Criminals sometimes hide things that they don't want the police to find.

His dog lives at his house with the policeman and his family.
Sometimes I see police cars on the side of the road.
The police stop people who are speeding or are not wearing their seatbelts.

Sometimes they even have to arrest people.

I like to make up things that aren't real.
I use my imagination.
I was pretending that I was in a time machine.
I set the date for a prehistoric time.
I turned on the time machine, and it buzzed and whirred and spun madly.
When it stopped spinning, I opened the door and stepped out into a very thick jungle.
I listened carefully to the sounds of the jungle.
I could hear strange animal noises, and the leaves were rustling.
I wasn't sure if I had gone back in time or had just landed in a jungle somewhere in the
twenty first century.
It didn't take me long to realize that I had indeed gone back in time.
A very strange bird-like creature with a large beak flew overhead.
I had never seen anything like it in my life.
I took a few steps out into the long grass and ferns.
I didn't want to go too far away from my time machine.
I heard a noise over on my right side.
There was a man who looked quite different from me.
He was dressed in an animal skin, and he carried a big stick.
I didn't want him to see me, so I hid behind a tree.
He didn't speak any language that I could understand.
He grunted at someone who must have been in the distance.
Then, I felt the earth shake beneath my feet.
I heard giant thumps on the ground as the floor of the jungle shook.
The man in the animal skin began to run.
I saw why he was running.
A giant dinosaur appeared above the tops of the trees.
It was bigger than anything I had ever seen.
My heart began to pound in my chest.
It was coming toward me.
I ran toward my time machine and jumped in.
I set the dial for the twenty-first century.
The machine whirred and buzzed.
My time machine landed in the twenty-first century.
I got away just in time.

Article #105 When I Grow Up

I have been thinking about what I'd like to be when I grow up.
There are so many choices.
I could be a principal like my father.
I could be a teacher.
I like animals.
Maybe I should be a veterinarian.
My cat just went to the veterinarian to get her shots.
I don't think my cat was too happy to be there.
I could be a farmer and grow vegetables.
Maybe I could be a doctor and cure people.
If I was good enough, I could be a famous sports person or a singer.
I could be an actor on television or in the movies.
Maybe I would like to be a policeman or a fireman.
I could rescue people.
I can play the piano.
Maybe I should be a musician.
I could be a lawyer.
I sometimes watch shows about lawyers defending people.
Lawyers have to be able to speak well.
I could be a carpenter and work with wood, or I could be a welder and work with metal.
There are just so many jobs.
I could work in a restaurant.
I could cook food, or I could serve food.
I could be an airline pilot or the captain of a ship.
I could be a repairman or an artist.
The world is full of jobs.
Some of the jobs require a lot of education.
Some require a little bit of training, and some require a lot of training.
It's all up to me.
I can be whatever I want to be.

Article #107 Making Friends

I used to be very shy.
I would not go up to someone that I did not know and say hello.
I was afraid that people would not want to talk to me.
I have changed.
I have become less shy.
I have learned that making friends is easy to do.
All you have to do is say hello.
Most people will respond to a smile and a friendly hello.
People will begin to talk to you about little things in their lives.
You will soon realize that you have something in common with that person.
Whenever I start talking to a new person I find that there is some interest that we share.
Maybe we know some of the same people, or we went to the same school.
Often we find that we like the same music or the same movies.
It is easy to have a conversation with someone once you find a topic that you both can relate to.
The most important part to making friends is to listen to what the other person says.
If you take an interest in them, they are sure to take an interest in you.
I have learned many things from meeting people.
I have had many fascinating conversations, and I have made a lot of good friends.
One day a girl came up to me and said that she was lost.
She couldn't find her way to her English class.
I said that I was going to that class too.
I told her to come with me.
We began talking, and we became very good friends.
That was a few years ago.
She is still one of my best friends.
Just think, if she hadn't been lost we might never have become friends.

Article #108 Getting Old

My grandfather is getting old.
When I was younger, my grandfather would carry me on his shoulders, and we would go
for a walk.
Now, my grandfather cannot put me on his shoulders.
He has a hard time walking, and he uses a cane.
My grandfather used to have lots of hair.
Now he is bald.
His skin doesn't look like it used to.
It is more wrinkled.
My grandfather takes more naps than he used to.
He goes to the doctor's, and he takes pills for his heart.
I love my grandfather very much.
I don't like the fact that he is getting older, but my mother says that growing older is just
a fact of life.
She says that we will all get older.
Sometimes my grandfather forgets things.
My mother says to be patient.
I am patient.
I try to help my grandfather as much as I can.

I help him to walk when he has trouble.
I cheer him up if I think he might be sad.

His stories are interesting.
Sometimes I wish we could trade places for a day so that I would know what it felt like to be old.
My grandfather doesn't complain.
He jokes about his old bones.
I spend a lot of time with my grandfather.
I hope that he is around for a long time.

Article #109 Time

Time is something that you should never waste.
Once an hour is gone, it is gone forever.
You should make the most of every minute.
Time is a funny thing.
Some days go by so slowly.
Those are the days that you do things that aren't fun.
When you are having fun, time just flies by.
Time is made up of different units.
Seconds turn into minutes.
Minutes turn into hours.
Hours turn into days.
Days turn into weeks.
Weeks turn into months, and months turn into years.
We measure our lives by time.
We are very concerned with time.
Even little children are very conscious of time.
Little children often want to appear older, so if you ask a three-year-old how old he is, he
will often say three and a half.
Many of our sayings are based on time.
"Give me a minute."
"Hold on a second."
"I'm running out of time."
"Time's up."
"I just want an hour of your time."
All of these are common things that we say, and they're all based on time.
We are a society that lives by the clock.
We almost all wear watches, and we glance at our watches a lot.
Time is something that we can't see, but it is a big factor in our lives.
How many times a day do you look at a watch or a clock?
I bet you'd be surprised at just how many times you do.

Article #110 Amy

Amy was a girl who came into our classroom.
She had many things wrong with her.
Amy was in a wheelchair, and she couldn't talk.
She couldn't make her hands and feet do what she wanted them to do.
We wondered why Amy would even be in our class, because she really couldn't do much of anything.
Amy had a teaching assistant who had to stay with her all the time.
One day the teaching assistant got called away.
I had to look after Amy.
I was afraid to look after her.
I really didn't know what to do.
I sat beside Amy, and I smiled at her.
She smiled back at me.
I never realized before that she had such a nice smile.
Amy made a noise.
It seemed like she wanted a crayon that was lying beside her.
I put the crayon into her hand.
She had trouble holding it, but eventually she got the crayon into her hand well enough
so that she could make marks on the paper that was on the tray in front of her.
Amy spent a long time making marks on the paper.
She tried so hard to create whatever it was that she was drawing.
She worked for a long time.
I just watched her, and I gave her a lot of credit for not giving up when she obviously had
so many problems.
When she was finally done, she picked up the paper with great difficulty.
With a look of pride on her face, she handed me the picture.
It was for me.
I was very touched that she spent all that time drawing something for me.
I thanked Amy and smiled at her.
I told her I loved the picture.
I still have that picture, although I'm not sure what it is a picture of.
I learned a lot from Amy that day.
I saw a brave girl who wouldn't give up.
Whenever I think my problems are too big to handle, I think of Amy and I remember her smile.

Article #111 Memories

Somebody once asked me what the most valuable things that I owned were.
I thought about that for a long time.
Then I realized that most of the things that I had could be replaced.
What I would not be able to replace were the photographs that I had of my friends and family.
Photographs are memories that are captured on film.
Some of the photographs are of people who are no longer with us.
I would hate to lose them.
Memories are precious.
They are all we have sometimes to link us to days gone by.
I remember the good times.
I try to relive them in my mind sometimes.
I remember the sad times.
Some of the sad memories are painful, but they are all a part of my life, and I don't want to lose any of my memories.
People come into our lives and people leave our lives, but most people leave a memory for us.
I have lots of memories, and when I look at my photographs, the memories come flooding back into my brain.
I remember what people were like when they were younger.
I remember vacations that I took.
I remember days that seemed ordinary at the time, but you never get to relive even the ordinary days.
Memories are so precious.
Cherish your memories, and keep them in a place close to your heart.
